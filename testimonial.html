    <div class="testi-part">
    <p>It is with great pleasure that I give you a letter of recommendation for the quality of work you and your staff performed at our offices recently. We were very impressed that there was no paint smell, no drops of paint anywhere, done on a timely basis and absolutely no need for you to come back for any touch-ups.

<br><br>The quality of your workmanship speaks for itself. We are now completing the remainder of the office decorating and decided not to get any other competitive quotes, as we knew your price would be fair and the job would be done to our complete satisfaction.

<br><br>We are pleased to recommend you to any client wanting quality workmanship.

<br><br>Yours Sincerely,
<br><br><span>Mrs. Marjut Coursaris
<br>Manager, Human Resources and Office Services
<br>Beutel, Goodman & Company Ltd.</span> </p>

 <p>I am writing to express my satisfaction at the painting work that was done by Leo Kunzendorff and his company 'All Seasons Painting and Decorating'.

<br><br>His team of painters were fast, efficient and did a very clean, neat job. I could find no problems or missed surfaces. They were very accommodating; willing to work around us for a day. I am very happy with the job that was done, and would highly recommend them for any job, small or large.

 <p>I am writing today to offer a recommendation on behalf of RBR Development Associates Limited to Mr. Leo Kunzendorff of All Seasons Painting and Decorating. ...

<br><br>..., I found Mr. Kunzendorff to be highly professional, and very competitive. Leo was the only painter to provide a list of references, in addition to taking time to follow-up with a phone call subsequent to the quotation provided. ...

<br><br>... The workmanship, in my opinion, is well above average. The walls were well- masked, and all of the furniture was adequately covered. No spills were found in any area of the office, and there was minimal smell from the paint. I would not hesitate to enlist the services of leo Kunzendorff and the All Seasons Painting and Decorating in the future, and I would also highly recommend him to anyone requiring residential or commercial painting at a reasonable price.

<br><br>Yours Sincerely,
<br><br><span>Paul Gray
